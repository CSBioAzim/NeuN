# the code of analyses of NeuN project
## FIRE folder contains the code of FIREs analysis
1. identification of FIREs and super-FREs
2. venn diagram for NeuN+ and NeuN- FIREs
3. differential FIREs definition and volcano plot for differential FIREs between NeuN+ and NeuN- FIREs cells
4. barplots for differential FIREs overlapping with differential H3K27ac ChIP-seq between NeuN+ and NeuN- cells
5. two representative plots of differential FIREs overlapping with gene promoters and boxplots for gene expression between NeuN+ and NeuN-    cells.
6. barplots for GO analyses of genes aggsigned to differential FIREs in NeuN+ and NeuN- cells
7. boxplot for expression levels of genes assigned to differential FIREs in NeuN+ and NeuN- cells
8. EWCE analysis for genes assigned to differential FIREs in NeuN+ and NeuN- cells
